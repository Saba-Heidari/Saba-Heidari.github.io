I am a PhD candidate at Marquette University.

I am a passionate researcher specializing in machine and deep learning, with a particular focus on computer vision and graph neural networks. My extensive experience in image processing and machine vision, especially within the medical domain, has enabled me to contribute to various critical projects, including image classification, image segmentation, and the development of generative adversarial networks (GANs). Additionally, I have actively explored neural architecture search and strategies to enhance the robustness of models against out-of-distribution data and adversarial attacks.

Currently, my research is centered on advancing the robustness of graph neural networks in the face of adversarially attacked inputs and perturbations.
